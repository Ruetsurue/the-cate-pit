#The Cate Pit Game

##Synopsis:

Work your way out of the pit full of Cate, being the mighty Doge that ain't afraid of nothin'.
Your momma raised you right.

As Doge Gode once said:
> Doge Gode is *disgusted* by Cate. And it's your borking job to woof 'em outta here.
> 
> But remember. Not all Cate r bad.

##Status:

WIP at the moment. Moving what I got to a repo to prevent progress loss.

To Do & notes to self:
* implement some actual player controls for battle and inventory management, lol. the game kinda plays itself as it is now.
* reorganise actions and Abilities. consider strategy pattern.
* finish the Encounter concept (combines with p.1)
* elaborate on the Agility stat. hit/miss/crit kinda thing
* same as above for Intelligence stat. implement the riddles
* implement gifts
* get some text art involved
* come up with whatever you please,  but remember: minimum viable game is better than a castle code dump in the sky
